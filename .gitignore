've created a detailed high-level design document for your scalable, resilient data pipeline system at 
scalable-data-pipeline-hld.md
.

The document covers:

Complete system architecture with all required components
Multi-tenancy isolation strategies
Dual processing paths for real-time and batch workloads
Resource allocation and fairness mechanisms
Failure recovery and resilience patterns
Technology recommendations for implementation
Scaling considerations to handle varying client loads
Security and compliance measures
Monitoring and metrics to ensure system health
The design specifically addresses your requirements for handling both high-volume and low-volume clients fairly, ensuring LLM processing bottlenecks don't impact the entire system, and maintaining data integrity throughout the pipeline.

Is there any particular aspect of the design you'd like me to elaborate on further?
